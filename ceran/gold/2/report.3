Skill reports:

farsight [FARS] 1: A mage with this skill may obtain region reports on
  distant regions. The report will be as if the mage was in the
  distant region himself. The target region must be within 4 times the
  caster's skill level squared regions of the caster. To use this
  skill, CAST Farsight REGION <x> <y>, where <x> and <y> are the
  coordinates of the region that you wish to view. Note that Farsight
  does not work in conjunction with other skills or spells; the mage
  can only rely on his normal facilities while casting Farsight. This
  skill requires pattern [PATT] 1, and spirit [SPIR] 1 to begin to
  study. This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.

combat [COMB] 1: This skill gives the unit a bonus in hand to hand
  combat. Also, a unit with this skill may TAX or PILLAGE. This skill
  costs 10 silver per month of study.

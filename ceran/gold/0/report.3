Skill reports:

pattern [PATT] 1: The Pattern skill is not directly useful to a mage,
  but is rather one of the Foundation skills on which other magical
  skills are based. A mage's Pattern skill indicates the ability to
  handle complex magical patterns, and is important for complicated
  tasks such as healing and controlling nature. This skill costs 100
  silver per month of study.

spirit [SPIR] 1: The Spirit skill is not directly useful to a mage,
  but is rather one of the Foundation skills on which other magical
  skills are based. Spirit skill indicates the mage's ability to
  control and affect magic and other powers beyond the material world.
  This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.

gate lore [GATE] 1: Gate Lore is the art of detecting and using
  magical Gates, which are spread through the world. The Gates are
  numbered in order, but spread out randomly, so there is no
  correlation between the Gate number and the Gate's location. A mage
  with skill 1 in Gate Lore can see a Gate if one exists in the same
  region as the mage. This detection is automatic; the Gate will
  appear in the region report. A mage with skill 1 in Gate Lore may
  also jump through a Gate into another region on the same level
  containing a gate, selected at random. To use Gate Lore in this
  manner, use the syntax CAST Gate_Lore RANDOM UNITS <unit> ... UNITS
  is followed by a list of units to follow the mage through the Gate
  (the mage always jumps through the Gate). At level 1, the mage may
  carry 15 weight units through the Gate (including the weight of the
  mage). This skill requires pattern [PATT] 1, and spirit [SPIR] 1 to
  begin to study. This skill costs 100 silver per month of study. This
  skill is studied at one half the normal speed.

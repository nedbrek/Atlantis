Skill reports:

force [FORC] 1: The Force skill is not directly useful to a mage, but
  is rather one of the Foundation skills on which other magical skills
  are based. The Force skill determines the power of the magical
  energy that a mage is able to use. Note that a Force skill level of
  0 does not indicate that a mage cannot use magical energy, but
  rather can only perform magical acts that do not require great
  amounts of power. This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.

/* Dependencies:
  A value of depend == -1 indicates no more dependencies.
  If depend is set to a skill, to study this skill, you must know
  the depended skill at level equal to (at least) the level in the
  structure, or at the level you are trying to study to.

  Example:
  SANDLE has depends[0].skill = SHOE and depends[0].level = 3.

  To study:   requires:
  SANDLE 1    SHOE 3
  SANDLE 2    SHOE 3
  SANDLE 3    SHOE 3
  SANDLE 4    SHOE 4
  SANDLE 5    SHOE 5
